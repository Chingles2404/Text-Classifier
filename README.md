# Text-Classifier
This repository was created from the [fastai-textclassifier](https://github.com/cowdinosaur/fastai-textclassifier) repository during a 4 days AI day camp organised by the [Defence Science and Technology Agency](https://www.dsta.gov.sg/home) from 25 Nov 2019 to 28 Nov 2019 in Singapore for a mini-competition held during the camp.

## About
The AI was created on a Google Colab notebook, which can be downloaded from [here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1JOWIlnqchZwYnL-Eqpqnv27ocd-jdDSp). The AI was supposed to differentiate between words in English, Spanish and Italian. However, we were somewhat unsuccessful due to our [dataset](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zd9QplswzaIFRh-o-e6-VpsQCMQMNoV0/view?usp=sharing) being too small, and biased. Furthermore, we were unsuccessful in deploying the project to [Render](https://render.com/) though we were unable to find out why.
